%%% Function to compute Feature_data.mat, a structure containing
%%% f_original, derivatives, second_derivatives, interesting_points 

% To make all features (except from the collision feature) twice
% continously differentiable everywhere, we chose 5th order polynomials.
% These polynomials always connect areas where the features are 0
% everywhere or 1 everywhere. e.g. the lane boundary feature is 0 at both
% boundaries of the road  + min_dist_boundary inwards the road on both
% sides to make sure the whole car is on the road. Everywhere in the road it is 1
% On the right side of the road, in between 0 and min_dist_boundary for the y value, 
% the polynomial increases from 0 to 1 such that at y = 0 and y =
% min_dist_boundary we are also twice differentiable.

% phi is the value of a single feature.

%% Key step: Specifiying the "interesting_points"
% The interesting points define where we connect the flat areas of features
% having value of 0 or 1 with the polynomial to make the transition from
% 0-->1 or 1-->0. Therefore we always look in the positive direction, i.e.,
% the direction where the state or control determining the feature grows.

% For each feature there are 2 cells in interesting_points. The first cell
% contains the points of the feature where the polynomial reaches the value
% 0 (and is then connected to an area where the features are all 0),
% whereas the second cell contains the points where the feature value
% reaches 1 and is connected to an area where the features are all 1. 

% If the value in the second cell of a feature is higher than the one in
% the first cell, this means that the feature value is ascending from 0 to
% 1 in positive direction. If the value in the first cell is larger than in
% the second cell, this means that we are descending from 1 to 0 feature
% value in positive direction.
% Each of the two cells contains a list of points of the same length as the
% other cell. The first point of cell 1 and cell 2 is compared, then the
% second point in both cells, etc...
interesting_points = cell(Number_features, 2);


%%% Feature 1 interesting points for road boundary feature
% Between being min_dist_boundary and min_dist_boundary + safety_margin_dist_road_boundary
% away from the edges of the road, the feature transitions from 0 at
% min_dist_boundary away from the edge to 1 at min_dist_boundary +
% safety_margin_dist_road_boundary away from the road edge. Therefore we
% have 1 ascend and one descend in positive y direction (first ascend from
% 0 to 1 then descend at the other side of the road to 0 again).

%%% Feature 2 interesting points for lane keeping feature
